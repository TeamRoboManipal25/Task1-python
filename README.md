## 📄 Task Description  

For this task, you will practice writing basic Python programs and pushing your code to GitHub using the **Git CLI**.  
There is **no separate report** for this task.  

👉 Two PDF guides will be provided:

- [**Second Year PDF**](task1_second_year.pdf) → Slightly advanced Python concepts

Follow the respective PDF as per your year.

## 🛠️ What You Have to Do  

1. Write the required Python programs as instructed in the PDF.  
2. Push your code to your private repository in the **RoboManipal2025** organization.  
3. Follow the folder structure rule:  

```

YourRepoName/
├── Task0/
│   └── (files for Task 0)
├── Task1/
│   ├── program1.py
│   ├── program2.py
│   └── ...

````

- Keep all Task 1 related files inside the `Task1` folder.  
- Name your `.py` files meaningfully (e.g., `factorial.py`, `fibonacci.py`).
